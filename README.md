# Hello There!

Welcome to my GitHub page. 
I am a full stack Ruby on Rails developer based in Ottawa, Canada. 
I have backend experience with RESTful APIs, PostgreSQL, as well as unit and integration testing using RSpec.
For front-end development, I work with Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus), JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind/Bulma CSS.
I am comfortable with using Git workflows, command-line development on macOS or linux, and deploying applications to Render.
I am looking for my next role, please do not hesitate to [shoot me an email!](mailto:megimu@gmail.com)
