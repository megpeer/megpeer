# Hello There!

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am currently deeply enbroiled in self-study, learning web development and Ruby on Rails. I started my journey in April 2024, with zero coding knowledge. I have come so far since then, and continue to look forward to learning, contributing and moving on into more engineer-focused roles. 

My main source of guidance for this journey has been the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). An open source self guided course teaching everything needed to build a solid foundation as a web developer.

So far I have completed a foundational course in javascript/html/CSS, have learned the Ruby language ([checkout my CLI chess game!](https://github.com/megpeer/chess))and now I am deep into learning Rails.

I most recently completed a project involving nested forms, stimulusJS and connected databases that simulates an airline flight booker. [check it out here!](https://flight-booker-gdhm.onrender.com/)

I am currently learning more about web sockets, and actioncable, and will be soon underway building a chat room app!

## My Past

I have an extensive career in the animation/VFX industry, and am currently working as an FX supervisor. 

I have lead teams on many complex shows under pressure and tight deadlines, been through the wringer figuring out many technical challenges, and consistently delivered high quality visuals. 



## The Future
I have learned that my brain is happiest when focused on engineering-type challenges. I love solving complex interconnected problems, untangling knots is my specialty. I am exited to be on this journey!
